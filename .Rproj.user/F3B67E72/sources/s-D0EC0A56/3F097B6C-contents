## PyMOL
### Introduction: What is PyMOL? 
PyMOL is a molecular visualization software used for 3D depictions of molecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, etc. 

### Why do scripting and not just use the graphical interface? 
While the graphical interface can seem less daunting and has less of a learning curve, scripting allows you to go back and change certain details that may be difficult just using the graphical interface. 

### How to approach/ (Hopefully) Helpful tips 
Other than just practicing, I think the biggest help for learning scripting is learning what the acronyms and certain key words mean. Having a pymol "cheat sheet" can aslo be extremely helpful. Here are some key details that I find to be useful. 

#### Setting up the interface
** bg white **
** hide nonbonded **
** set seq_view, 1 **

#### Loading in a protein(s)
Sometimes, it can appear that the script works fine when manually inputting lines one by one but when running an entire script, it fails to run. In this case, it is important to use the async=0 so that PyMOL understands to pause until the protein(s) has loaded before proceeding. Also something to note, currently, when fetching directly from PyMOL, files download as a .CIF instead of a .PDB. You can change this by adding type=pdb. 

** fetch 3lwb, type=pdb, async=0  ** 

#### Booleans
Reviewing booleans for "and", "or", "not" can be helpful when selecting molecules. 
For example: 

** select 3lwb_active_water, ((ligands) around 3.2) and (resn HOH) & ! 1iow **
