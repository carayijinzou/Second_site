abstract: "**Objectives:** Salivary glands (SG) experience progressive injury when exposed to repeat
radiotherapy treatment for head-and-neck cancers, and chronic inflammation from conditions
like Sjogrenâ€™s syndrome. Regenerative engineering seeks to restore functional SG through
encapsulation of healthy human SG stem/progenitor cells (hS/PCs) within hyaluronan (HA)-
based hydrogels, and return of these composite structures to the site of injury. This process of
ex vivo epithelial hS/PC isolation and expansion may be limited by the rate of cell proliferation in
3D hydrogels, and the ability to drive phenotypic organization without the inherent cues of the
native SG microenvironment. Driven by our knowledge of epithelial-stromal interactions, and by
the composition of the target site for reimplantation, we were inspired to co-encapsulate hS/PCs
alongside SG microtissues within HA hydrogels, to determine if this hybrid culture system could
impact positively the growth, organization, or function of hS/PCs via paracrine and/or juxtacrine
signaling. We hypothesized that co-culture with these microtissues could accelerate desired
features for neogland development.


**Experimental Methods:** hS/PCs (2-3 x106 cells/mL) were suspended within HA-SH solutions
and crosslinked into hydrogels alongside small SG microtissues. Cell+tissue+gel composites
(and cell+gel controls) were cultured over time (2-3 weeks) in humanized salivary media and
assessed via fluorescent viability staining and confocal microscopy imaging as z-stacks. The
captured z-stacks then were reconstructed within IMARIS software, and quantified digitally for
changes in hS/PC cluster size, cell number per cluster, and cluster morphology.


**Results:** hS/PCs consistently formed larger structures when co-encapsulated with microtissues.
IMARIS allowed for more detailed measurement of hS/PC cluster composition and 3D
morphology than possible with conventional 2D imaging methods.
Conclusion: Tissue-assisted co-cultures promoted hS/PC growth and confirmed prior results of
hS/PC co-culture with fibroblasts. These observations may assist in modeling in vivo
biointegration performance or in ex vivo acceleration of cell growth, organization, and function
prior to implantation.
