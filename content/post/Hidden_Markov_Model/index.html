<div id="hidden-markov-model" class="section level2">
<h2>Hidden Markov Model</h2>
<p>I go over the basics of a Markov Chain here, however, unlike chutes and ladders, for a hidden markov model, there is hidden information. The markov chain is not visible to us, we can only observe outcome values.</p>
</div>
<div id="emission-probability" class="section level2">
<h2>Emission probability</h2>
<p>The <strong>emission probability</strong> is what gives way to the observed state (or the markov state).</p>
</div>
<div id="forward-algorithm" class="section level2">
<h2>Forward Algorithm</h2>
<p>What is the probability of a certain state at each time given the observations?</p>
</div>
<div id="viterbi-algorithm" class="section level2">
<h2>Viterbi Algorithm</h2>
<p>What is the probabiltiy of our entire set of observations given a state path?</p>

<h2>Application</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/alfrandom/protein-secondary-structure/data">This</a> is a good exercise to test your understanding. It looks at predicting the secondary structure of proteins from the primary sequence.</p>
