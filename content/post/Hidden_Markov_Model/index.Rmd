## Hidden Markov Model
I go over the basics of a Markov Chain [here](../Markov_chain), however, unlike chutes and ladders, for a hidden markov model, there is hidden information. The markov chain is not visible to us, we can only observe outcome values. 

## Emission probability
The **emission probability** is what gives way to the observed state (or the markov state).

## Forward Algorithm
What is the probability of a certain state at each time given the observations? 

## Viterbi Algorithm
What is the probabiltiy of our entire set of observations given a state path?

## HMM Package in R 


## Application
[This](https://www.kaggle.com/alfrandom/protein-secondary-structure/data) is a good exercise to test your understanding. It looks at predicting the secondary structure of proteins from the primary sequence.
